# React Capstone Project - Metrics Webapp

This React capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that you will create making use of React and Redux.

I selected an API that provides numeric data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have several pages:. I also learned how to apply JavaScript best practices and language style guides in code. We used AAA pattern for unit tests.
Write units tests for a JavaScript app and make JavaScript code asynchronous.
Most importantly we performed a code review for each team member. [Find project specifications here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/capstone/react_capstone.md)

## Project description

This project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that you will create making use of React and Redux and also making a call from an API.

## Inner working

The application make API calls to the Narrativa API: COVID-19 data. retrieving information about the CONFIREMD, RETRIVED, DEATH, RECOVERED and TOTAL case of COVID mertic data of a region. First I choosed an API called [Narrativa API](https://covid19tracking.narrativa.com/index_en.html) to base the development of the mobileapp on. The API should allow you to get numeric values based on a parameter. Recommended that I choose an API that is open or needs an API key. If you choose an API that require authentication, you should implement it on your own.

~~~

Run `npm install` to install the node modules and webpacker.

Run `npm run build` to build the bundler and build the webpack.

Run `npm run start` on a Terminal to start the server and look at the result in `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

## API Information

### Narrativa API

- For getting the list of COVID data metrics, the [Narrativa API](https://covid19tracking.narrativa.com/index_en.html) was used.

- One methods were implemented: To get a list of COVID data Metrics. 

- The base URL for searching the COVID metrics: `https://api.covid19tracking.narrativa.com/api/`.

- The base URL for getting information for a counrty `'https://api.covid19tracking.narrativa.com/api/2020-03-22/country/spain' + ?date_from=2020-03-20&date_to=2020-03-22;` where id is the date.

- The result of calling this API is an array containing several fields which can be queried using dot notation.

#### New app

- To create a app, send a GET action to the base URL + `/apps/` without any parameter:

- The result will be the code for the further API calls: 

#### COUNTRIES

- To get a list of all likes for all the items (movies), send a GET action to the base URL + `[/apps/:app_id/likes/](https://api.covid19tracking.narrativa.com/api/2020-03-22/country/spain)`:

- The response will be something like:
